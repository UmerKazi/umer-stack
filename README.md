This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-umer-app`](https://github.com/UmerKazi/create-umer-app).

## Getting Started

First, create an environemnt file in the root of your project. Title the file `.env.local` and populate the contents with your firebase credentials as so...

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`firebase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package//firebase) for backend connectivity, as well as [`@mui/material`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material) for frontend components.
